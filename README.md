#Usage

Given that the user needs/wants to answer a set of multiple choice questions, this page provides a set of questions with a given goal to answer
all the questions before the timer runs out.

The page starts with a welcome page that includes a button to start the quiz. Once the button is pressed, a timer is set for ten seconds:

    * Given that the user answers the question correctly, they can then move onto the next question. Though if the user answers the question incorrectly, 2 seconds is taken off of the timer.

    * If the the user can finish the set of questions before the timer runs out, they are then directed to a page that declares that the user has won. They are then given the choice to enter their name and email to a highscore list and also the option to try again.
    
    * In the situation that the timer runs down to 0, the user is then directed to a page that states that the time is up and that the user has lost. The user is still given the choice to enter their name and email to a highscore list and also the option to try again.
    
    * If the user presses the try again button, they are redirected to question one and the timer restarts.

        This assignment was neccessary for me to really understand the process of DOM manipulation. I learned how methods, functions, and variables can apply to bare bones HTML document; such as:
        * getting, creating, and manipulating elements given the application of particular events.
        * Setting timers
        * The application of DOM Methods
    
        Prior to doing this assignment, I had little to no grasp of how DOM manipulation really worked; though I still don't think I know enough to really apply the technique very effeciently, I am now excited to apply it to future projects with better context of how it works.
    
            I think what will make my project stand out is the portrayal how many other methods I needed to research on my own to make my project work efficently!
